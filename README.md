- **Dashboard**: A personalized dashboard displaying recommended opportunities, application status, and upcoming events.
- **Post Vacancies**: Companies can post job vacancies and internship opportunities specifying job roles, required skills, and location.
- **Application Management**: Companies can manage job applications, review resumes, and communicate with applicants through the platform.
- **Admin Panel**: An admin panel to manage users, monitor activity, and perform administrative tasks.
